LinkCPR is a small boutique First Aid Training RTO with partner trainers. LinkCPR had paper registration forms, paper texts and manually validating USIs.

Mimising the change from the way things currently worked was key. LinkCPR chose CourseSales.com for their availability and a proposal to deliver a solution that rolled out in stages, but minimised the changes while the new ways of working were implmented. 

Stage one involved:
* Customer contacts at the medical centers were engaged to distribute invitations to those staff who needed to register for the course. 
* Existing, proven website instructions were incorporated into instructions on the registration form. 
* Downloadable PDFs were also offered in the instructions as pre-course reading, initially with a test that students were asked to download, print and bring to the course.
* Registration Lists were provided to trainers to mark attendance and attach any notes. A downloadable version was also supplied to update with outcomes. 

The second stage, a number of months later, included:
* Introducing an online test in the registration process, ie: register with reduced reporting then immediately invited to complete the test online.
* An email sent to the student with a link to the test in case students didn't complete the test after registration or decided to schedule an alernative time. 
* Once successfully complete the trainer is sent an email.

<b>Next steps</b> for LinkCPR are to use the Postcode/locality validation to minimise AVETMISS errors.

The following benefits come from this approach:

The migration was successful, and after dedicated training to the Partner trainers, including face to face and online training the system has become a standard way of delivering for LinkCPR.
