Testing students is an important part of any FirstAid or CPR related course. Auditors want to make sure that the testing is done such that the theory is not a mere obstacle to be overcome but is a true test of knowledge and results in a better student. 

There is theoretical information in FirstAid and CPR that needs to be evaluated before a student can be considered competent in a First Aid or CPR course. Once your questions pass the topic evaluation adding these to the software is easy. But once you have the questions it is necessary to then make some decisions about the following:

<b>How many time should a student be allowed to submit their answers?</b>Submitting answers shows the student which answers are correct and which are wrong:
* Too few (less than 3) attempts might mean that the customer does not get an option to correct any obviously wrong answers or learn from their mistakes.
* Too many answers (4 to unlimited) might mean that students can effectively guess the answers to multichoice questions ie cycle through each option (assuming 4 options is common). 
* Just right - this balances the two scenarios mentioned above, something that allows less guessing but give the student the opportunity to learn from their mistakes.

<b>Should you allow the student to 'save draft' attempts?</b> When they do this it does not inform the student which are correct and wrong, but saves the attempts:
* Saving as draft when the student has unlimited attempts does not make a lot of sense, there is little advantage to saving draft copies compared to submitting.  
* Saving as draft allows the student to keep a record of their work to date, in case of timeouts or they mistakenly visit another page etc. 

<b>Customise the pages to display for pass and fail.</b> By displaying a different message to the student you can give them specific instructions or information. 
<b>Customise which emails to send based on a pass or fail.</b> You could also email a trainer to make contact or invite the student to attempt once more. 

<b>Each Auditor has different expectations</b>

An Auditor's expectations is to ensure the rigour of the testing process and most important is that a record is kept of the test results. Within the software these are stored in the statuses of the work flow. Additionally making modifications to the quiz is a quick and easy thing to do - most of these settings are on the form itself. Adjust these while the Auditor is there and they should be happy.

<b>Special note:</b> if you provide language literacy and numeracy tests then the same information above can be applied to them. 

In summary consider the following:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw  %}
Number of submit attempts
Allowing students to 'save draft'
Customised page upon final submission
Customised emails
{% endraw  %}
{% endhighlight %}

The test can be included in the registration process, usually after payment, and links to the test can be emailed or sent via sms to the student.
