The software used by the First Aid Student Management System is coursesales.com - a popular student management system that is unique in the way it allows complete customisation for industries and ways of working. 

It is nice to know that a solid organisation is behind you when you are working with Information Technology. The First Aid Student Management System is backed up both in support and continuous development by CourseSales.com - which has a team of people and the history of delivering robust and reliable solutions to training companies for 8 years. 

Within the First Aid Student Management System what is different to coursesales.com?

You will be pleased to know that the functionality is exactly the same - there is only one version of coursesales.com in use at any one time. This means that you get all the latest and greatest features as they become available. The differences are related to the setup and configuration. These include:

* specific courses are pre-configured for first aid teaching environments
* staff who help you are specifically trained in understanding the needs of first aid training companies
* there is a on-boarding plan that covers all the important aspects of a first aid training company, refined following the many other organisations we have helped
* the default configuration often already meets your needs as a First Aid training organisation.
